# Ticketing System with Vite, React, Supabase, and SCSS

This is a simple ticketing system built with **Vite**, **React**, **Supabase**, and **SCSS**. Users can sign up, log in, create tickets, and manage ticket status, categories, and priority levels. The app integrates with Supabase for authentication and data storage.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth.
- **Create Tickets**: Users can create new tickets with a title, description, category, status, and priority level.
- **Ticket Management**: Users can view all tickets, with details on category, status, and priority.
- **SCSS Styling**: Global styles are managed using SCSS.
- **Error Handling**: Error boundaries are used to catch and display errors during runtime.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Supabase**: A backend-as-a-service platform that provides authentication and database solutions.
- **SCSS**: CSS preprocessor for cleaner, more efficient styling.
